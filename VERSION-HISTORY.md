# XDL Version History

## Versioning Scheme: Periodic Table Elements 🧪

The XDL (Azure SQL Development Environment) follows a unique versioning scheme based on the periodic table of elements. Each version corresponds to an element number, providing both structure and memorable naming.

### Version Format
- **Pattern**: `X.Y.Z ELEMENT_NAME`
- **Element Number**: Calculated as XYZ (e.g., 0.0.1 = Element #1)
- **Element Symbol**: Included for reference
- **GitHub Badges**: Stylized shields linked to version history
- **Emoji**: Chemical/scientific theme

### GitHub Badge Examples
